- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should be documented
- Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x)
- All files must be executable

## Function Prototype

```python
def minOperations(n):
